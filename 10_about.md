Besides wanting to create my own little git project, i wanted to create an easily customizable multi-select-widget, 
which has the original select as the base for all actions. that means all actions through the ui result in direct 
changes to the select, thus keeping it always up-to-date and all changes to the select (or its options) result in 
direct adjustment of the ui. e.g. disabling an option through dom-change will disable the ui-option.


## The concept

Let's start width something to see - my (early) widget conception

## Final words

One thing left to mention: this page is created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
